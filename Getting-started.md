# First steps after starting for the first time
_[Back to Homepage](home)_

After starting the app for the first time, you will notice that the app is mostly white.

The reason for that is that you haven't logged in to MyAnimeList yet.

`Open the Settings window` by clicking the `cog icon` in the `top right corner` of the application.

After that, a window pops up and gives you a diverse amount of things you can do.

`To log in` to MyAnimeList, we have to `switch` to the `MyAnimeList` tab. There we find a `login mask`.
